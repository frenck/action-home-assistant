üöÄ Frenck's GitHub Action for running a Home Assistant Core configuration check.

## About

This GitHub action runs a Home Assistant Core configuration check against your
repository.

Please note; that this Action is useable for all Home Assistant installation
types, and thus **NOT** limited to Home Assistant Core users. It also works
if you are running Home Assistant Container, Supervised or OS.

## Usage

```yaml
name: Check
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  home-assistant:
    name: Home Assistant Core Configuration Check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: ‚§µÔ∏è Check out configuration from GitHub
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: üöÄ Run Home Assistant Configuration Check
        uses: frenck/action-home-assistant@v1
        with:
          path: "./config"
          secrets: fakesecrets.yaml
          version: stable
```

## Arguments

|   Input    |                             Description                              |   Usage    |
| :--------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------: |
| `env_file` |              Possible path to environment file to use.               | _Optional_ |
|   `path`   | Path to the folder containing the Home Assistant Core configuration. | _Optional_ |
| `secrets`  |      Alternative secrets file to use, e.g., "fakesecrets.yaml".      | _Optional_ |
| `version`  |    Version to use; dev/beta/stable or a specific version number.     | _Optional_ |

### Specific configuration folder

By default, this GitHub Action will use the root folder as the Home Assistant
Core configuration folder. If you store your Home Assistant configuration in a
subfolder, the `path` argument can be used to inform the Action about that.

For example, if your configuration is in the `config` folder:

```yaml
- name: üöÄ Run Home Assistant Core Configuration Check
  uses: frenck/action-home-assistant@v1
  with:
    path: "./config"
```

### Using a fake secrets file

Of course, you don't want to commit your secrets file. However, without a
secrets file, your configuration check will most likely not pass.

This GitHub Action offers a way around that, but using a fake secrets file.

To use this, add a fake secrets file to your repository (e.g.,
`fakesecrets.yaml`) and make sure the content is the same as your real
`secrets.yaml` (with, of course, fake credentials/data). The GitHub Action
will use this file while checking your configuration.

For example, if you fake secrets file is `fakesecrets.yaml`:

```yaml
- name: üöÄ Run Home Assistant Core Configuration Check
  uses: frenck/action-home-assistant@v1
  with:
    secrets: "fakesecrets.yaml"
```

### Running against a specific version

This GitHub Action allows you to specify a specific version to run
your Home Assistant Core configuration against. However, by default, the
integration will try to find the `.HA_VERSION` file in your configuration
folder.

If the `.HA_VERSION` file is found, the version in that file is used. If
the `.HA_VERSION` file is not found; the Action will use the latest stable
version of Home Assistant to test your configuration.

However, you can specify/override any version you like to check against,
for example, check with Home Assistant Core `2021.1.0`:

```yaml
- name: üöÄ Run Home Assistant Core Configuration Check
  uses: frenck/action-home-assistant@v1
  with:
    version: "2021.1.0"
```

Alternatively, you can also use `stable`, `beta` or `dev` to run against
the latest versions of those stability channels.

```yaml
- name: üöÄ Run Home Assistant Core Configuration Check
  uses: frenck/action-home-assistant@v1
  with:
    version: beta
```

## More extensive example

A more extensive example, that runs your configuration against the latest
development, beta and stable versions:

```yaml
name: Check
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  home-assistant:
    name: "Home Assistant Core ${{ matrix.version }} Configuration Check"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        version: ["stable", "beta", "dev"]
    steps:
      - name: ‚§µÔ∏è Check out configuration from GitHub
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: üöÄ Run Home Assistant Configuration Check
        uses: frenck/action-home-assistant@v1
        with:
          path: "./config"
          secrets: fakesecrets.yaml
          version: "${{ matrix.version }}"
```

## Changelog & Releases

This repository keeps a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality.

Releases are based on [Semantic Versioning][semver], and use the format
of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. In a nutshell, the version will be incremented
based on the following:

- `MAJOR`: Incompatible or major changes.
- `MINOR`: Backwards-compatible new features and enhancements.
- `PATCH`: Backwards-compatible bugfixes and package updates.

## Versions & Updating

You can specify which version of this GitHub Action your workflow should use.
And even allowing for using the latest major or minor version.

For example; this will use release `v1.1.1` of a GitHub Action:

```yaml
- name: üöÄ Run Home Assistant Configuration Check
  uses: frenck/action-home-assistant@v1.1.1
```

While the following example, will use the `v1.1.x` minor release, for example
if `v1.1.2` is the latest releases (starting with `v1.1`), this will run
`v1.1.2`:

```yaml
- name: üöÄ Run Home Assistant Configuration Check
  uses: frenck/action-home-assistant@v1.1
```

As in the examples throughout the documentation, the following example is
locked on major version, meaning any `v1.x.x` latest version will be used,
as long as it is version 1.

```yaml
- name: üöÄ Run Home Assistant Configuration Check
  uses: frenck/action-home-assistant@v1
```

### Automatically update using Dependabot

The advantage of locking against a more specific version, is that it prevents
surprises if an issue or breaking changes were introduced in a newer release.

The disadvantage of being more specific, is that it requires you to keep things
up to date. Fortunately, GitHub has a tool for that, called: Dependabot.

Dependabot can automatically open a pull request on your repository to update
this Action for you. You can instantly see if the new version works (as the
pull request shows the success or failure status) and you can decide to
merge it in by hitting the merge button. Quick, easy and always up2date.

To enable Dependabot, create a file called `.github/dependabot.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: daily
```

Your all set! Dependabot will now check (and update) your GitHub actions
every day. ü§©
